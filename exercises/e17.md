# Let's make some other useful applicatives

Javascript gives us a lot of good applicatives for free, but not everything our heart desires. We will often run into cases where we can benefit a lot from this style of programming even if we don't get these functions for free.

In this exercise we're going to make 2 applicatives `minBy` and `maxBy` that work like this
```js
const oldestPerson = maxBy(
  [
    { name: "jon", age: 29 },
    { name: "peter", age: 30 },
    { name: "andrey", age: 22 },
  ],
  (person) => person.age
); // gives us { name: "peter", age: 30 }

const youngestPerson = minBy(
  [
    { name: "jon", age: 29 },
    { name: "peter", age: 30 },
    { name: "andrey", age: 22 },
  ],
  (person) => person.age
); // gives us { name: "andrey", age: 22 }
```

 For this exercise we want you to make custom `maxBy` and `minBy` methods. In order to do this **it is ok to use a loop**.

a minBy function should
• Take an array of things
• return a the element where the callback function on that element yields the lowest value

a maxBy function should
• Take an array of things
• return a the element where the callback function on that element yields the highest value
