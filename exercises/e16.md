# Let's make some applicatives

The idea of an applicative function is that we can **APPLY** a callback function to a general purpose function in order to attain specific functionality. Let's take a look at a custom implementation of filter.

A filter should:
• Take an array of things
• return a new array of things that do not return something truthey from their callback

```js
function filter(array, callback) {
  let returnArray = [];

  for (let element of array) {
    // Only if the callback that we apply returns something truthy, does it get pushed into the new array
    if (callback(element)) {
      returnArray.push(element);
    }
  }

  return returnArray;
}
```

 For this exercise we want you to make a custom `find` method. In order to do this **it is ok to use a loop**.

a find function should
• Take an array of things
• return a the first thing where the applied callback is truthey
